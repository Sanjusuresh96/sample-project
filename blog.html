					<p class="card-text">React applications grow in complexity, it can become increasingly difficult to keep track of components, state, and props. Last month, a few developers and I worked on building a solution to this problem. We decided to create React Scope, a Chrome extension that provides a hierarchical-tree view of a developer’s React app components.React Scope is also interactive; as developers trigger state changes within their app the tree diagram is updated accordingly. The ability to visualize state changes and identify where props are being passed down can make debugging React applications much easier.</p>
